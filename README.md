Here are the differences between the original code and the modified code, along with the reasons and effects of the modifications:

### 1. **MotionCapture (Python Code):**
   - **Original Code:**
     - Uses relative paths to open the video (`Video.mp4`) and save the `AnimationFile.txt` file.
     - Body position data is written to the `AnimationFile.txt` file whenever the user presses 's' key.
   - **My Code:**
     - Uses absolute paths to open the `AnimationFile.txt` file from a specific location on the drive.
  
### 2. **AnimationCode (C# Code):**
   - **Original Code:**
     - Uses `Thread.Sleep(30)` to pause updating the position of the object in each frame.
   - **My Code:**
     - Eliminates the use of `Thread.Sleep(30)` and instead updates the position of the object in each frame without pausing. 
     - This helps avoid game freezing and makes the program run smoother.
  
### Reasons and Effects of the Modifications:
   - **Using Absolute Paths in MotionCapture (Python Code):**
     - **Reason:** Ensures that the code will work correctly when run from any location on the drive.
     - **Effect:** Increases the flexibility and mobility of the code, not dependent on being executed from a fixed location on the drive.

   - **Removing Thread.Sleep in AnimationCode (C# Code):**
     - **Reason:** Avoids game freezing and helps the program run smoother.
     - **Effect:** Improves user experience and makes the program operate more efficiently.

Overall, these modifications improve the stability and performance of the program, as well as make the code easier to maintain and expand in the future
