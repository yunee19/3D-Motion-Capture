# Works:

#### Python Program in PyCharm:
#### Code(MotionCapture.py):

      if bboxInfo:
        frame_pos_list = []
        for lm in lmList:
            # Ensure lm has at least 3 elements (x, y, z)
            if len(lm) >= 3:
                # Extract x, y, and z coordinates
                x, y, z = lm[:3]
                # Append to frame_pos_list
                frame_pos_list.extend([x, y, z])

        # Convert frame_pos_list to comma-separated string
        frame_pos_str = ','.join(map(str, frame_pos_list))

        # Append frame_pos_str to posList
        posList.append(frame_pos_str)

        print(len(posList))

    cv2.imshow("Image", img)

    # Capture key press
    key = cv2.waitKey(1)

    # Break loop on 'q' key press
    if key & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
    # Save data on 's' key press
    elif key & 0xFF == ord('s'):
        with open("AnimationFile.txt", 'w') as f:
            f.writelines("%s\n" % item for item in posList)
        print("Data saved to AnimationFile.txt")

#### How it works:
- Utilizes the OpenCV library to read video and detect coordinates of key points on the human body.
- Coordinates are stored in a list and written to the AnimationFile.txt file.
- Each line in the file contains coordinates of key points in a video frame.

#### Applications:
- Performs Motion Capture from a video recorded using a standard webcam.

### C# Source Code in Unity:
#### Code(AnnimationCode):

      public class AnimationCode : MonoBehaviour
{

    public GameObject[] Body;
    List<string> lines;
    int counter = 0;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
       lines = System.IO.File.ReadLines("C:\\Users\\user\\MotionCapture\\Assets\\AnimationFile.txt").ToList();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        string[] points = lines[counter].Split(',');

        for(int i = 0; i <=32; i++) 
        {
            float x = float.Parse(points[0 + (i * 3)]) / 100;
            float y = float.Parse(points[1 + (i * 3)]) / 100;
            float z = float.Parse(points[2 + (i * 3)]) / 300;
            Body[i].transform.localPosition = new Vector3(x, -y, z);

#### How it works:
- Uses Unity to create a 3D environment and display objects.
- Reads data from the AnimationFile.txt file generated by the Python program.
- Each frame, it updates the position of objects in the 3D environment based on the positional data from the file.

#### Applications:
- Replicates human body movements from Motion Capture data in Unity into 3D.

Here are the differences between the original code and the modified code, along with the reasons and effects of the modifications:

### 1. **MotionCapture (Python Code):**
   - **Original Code:**
     - Uses relative paths to open the video (`Video.mp4`) and save the `AnimationFile.txt` file.
     - Body position data is written to the `AnimationFile.txt` file whenever the user presses 's' key.
   - **My Code:**
     - Uses absolute paths to open the `AnimationFile.txt` file from a specific location on the drive.
  
### 2. **AnimationCode (C# Code):**
   - **Original Code:**
     - Uses `Thread.Sleep(30)` to pause updating the position of the object in each frame.
   - **My Code:**
     - Eliminates the use of `Thread.Sleep(30)` and instead updates the position of the object in each frame without pausing. 
     - This helps avoid game freezing and makes the program run smoother.
  
### Reasons and Effects of the Modifications:
   - **Using Absolute Paths in MotionCapture (Python Code):**
     - **Reason:** Ensures that the code will work correctly when run from any location on the drive.
     - **Effect:** Increases the flexibility and mobility of the code, not dependent on being executed from a fixed location on the drive.

   - **Removing Thread.Sleep in AnimationCode (C# Code):**
     - **Reason:** Avoids game freezing and helps the program run smoother.
     - **Effect:** Improves user experience and makes the program operate more efficiently.

Overall, these modifications improve the stability and performance of the program, as well as make the code easier to maintain and expand in the future
